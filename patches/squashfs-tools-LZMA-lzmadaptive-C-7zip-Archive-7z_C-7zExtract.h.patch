+    these values from previous call:
+      *blockIndex, 
+      *outBuffer, 
+      *outBufferSize
+    You can consider "*outBuffer" as cache of solid block. If your archive is solid, 
+    it will increase decompression speed.
+  
+    If you use external function, you can declare these 3 cache variables 
+    (blockIndex, outBuffer, outBufferSize) as static in that external function.
+    
+    Free *outBuffer and set *outBuffer to 0, if you want to flush cache.
